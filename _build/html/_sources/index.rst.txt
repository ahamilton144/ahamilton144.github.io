Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University, working with Professor Pat Reedâ€™s `Decision Analytics for Complex Systems <https://reed.cee.cornell.edu>`_ group. I completed my PhD in Environmental Sciences and Engineering at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I worked with Professor Greg Characklis at the `Center on Financial Risk in Environmental Systems <https://sph.unc.edu/cfres/center-on-financial-risk-in-environmental-systems>`_. Before coming to UNC, I earned a Masters in Environmental Management at Duke University, specializing in Water Resources Management and Geospatial Analysis. Additionally, I have an MS in Materials from UC-Santa Barbara and a BSE in Engineering Physics and Mathematics from Tulane University.

My research sits at the intersection of water resource systems engineering, environmental science, financial analysis, and decision science. I aim to improve our understanding of risk and decision-making within coupled natural-human systems, and to provide stakeholders with decision-aiding tools that can help them to more effectively navigate the uncertainties, tradeoffs, and conflicts within these complex systems.
