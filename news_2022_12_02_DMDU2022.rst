[2022-12-02] Presentation at 2022 DMDU Meeting
==============

Last month I had the opportunity to attend the `2022 Annual Meeting <https://www.2022dmdu.org/>`_ of the Society for Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU), held in Mexico City, Mexico. I presented on "Key challenges for defining and designing robust infrastructure partnerships in deeply uncertain many-actor water supply networks," with Rohini Gupta, Pat Reed, HB Zeff, and Greg Characklis.
