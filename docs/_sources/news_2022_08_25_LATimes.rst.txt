==============

I was interviewed by the LA Times' Hayley Smith for the article `"California's water from Colorado River could be crippled by a big earthquake. Drought makes fixes vital" <https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-08-23/california-water-supply-shrinking-mwd-earthquake-leaks>`_. We discussed California's ongoing drought, infrastructure, natural hazards, and our recent `open access paper in Earth's Future <https://doi.org/10.1029/2021EF002573>`_.
