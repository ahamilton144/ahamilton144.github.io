[2023-05-25] Presentation at 2023 EWRI World Congress
==============

This week I had the opportunity to attend the 2023 World Congress of the ASCE Environmental and Water Resources Institute in Henderson, NV. I presented my research on "Discovering key tradeoffs and consequential vulnerabilities for robust water supply investment partnerships under deep uncertainty," with Rohini Gupta, Pat Reed, HB Zeff, and Greg Characklis.
